                                        <p>We we're so young yet true to our
                                            feelings. I wanna go back to the
                                            very first day I laid my eyes on you
                                            and it mesmerized me how beautiful
                                            and handsome you are. I wish I could
                                            go back to that day, just to feel
                                            the butterflies again the same
                                            butterflies that never really left.
                                            Even now, every time I see you, I’m
                                            reminded of that first moment, and
                                            my heart skips the same way it did
                                            back then. That first glance turned
                                            into a memory I’ll always treasure,
                                            because it was the beginning of
                                            us.</p>

                                        <p>When you help me with my studies, it
                                            shows me that we’re not just
                                            partners in love, but also in
                                            learning and becoming better
                                            together. Your patience when you
                                            explain things to me makes me feel
                                            cared for and understood. Every time
                                            you guide me, it feels like we’re
                                            slowly building our future side by
                                            side. Even in something as simple as
                                            studying, you make me feel loved,
                                            because you choose to share your
                                            time and effort with me. Our
                                            relationship feels stronger because
                                            we don’t just enjoy the happy
                                            moments, we also support each other
                                            through challenges like
                                            schoolwork.</p>

                                            show how real and effortless our
                                            bond is we’re comfortable anywhere,

                                            special, just by sitting on the
                                            sidewalk, eating tokneneng or shake,
                                            and enjoying each other’s company.
                                            Our love is strong because it’s
                                            simple. We don’t need to impress
                                            each other with grand gestures our
                                            bond shines in little things.</p>
